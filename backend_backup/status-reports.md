## BUILD ISSUE: Tailwind Custom Colors - 00:16 UTC

### 🚨 Critical Build Failure

**Issue**: New design system custom colors causing build failures
**Root Cause**: Custom design tokens not properly configured in Tailwind
**Status**: Both Designer and Developer alerted

**Problem**: 
- UI Designer introduced custom colors
- tailwind.config.js doesn't include new color definitions
- Build process failing due to undefined color classes

**Solution in Progress**:
1. **Designer** (Window 4): Share exact color values and naming
2. **Developer** (Window 1): Update tailwind.config.js theme extension
3. **Both**: Coordinate on design token configuration

**Common Fix Pattern**:
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'custom-primary': '#hex-value',
        'custom-secondary': '#hex-value'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Priority**: Critical - blocking development progress

This is a standard issue when implementing custom design systems with Tailwind!

## Salt Documentation Technical Correction - 00:18 UTC

### 🔧 VRF Accuracy Update Required

**Critical Correction Needed**:
- Original salt documentation had general cryptography explanation
- **CORRECTED**: Primary purpose is VRF (Verifiable Random Function) limitation
- **KEY POINT**: VRF only allows ONE result per entity hash

**VRF Anti-Tampering Mechanism**:
1. VRF never allows same entity hash to be used twice
2. Prevents "cooking" results by multiple attempts  
3. Forces commitment to final data + salt before randomness
4. Core trust mechanism of the system

**Developer Status**:
- 🔄 Updating salt section with correct VRF technical explanation
- Emphasizing one-result-per-hash limitation
- Highlighting anti-tampering as primary benefit

**Updated Focus**:
- ❌ ~~General cryptography concepts~~
- ✅ **VRF-specific trust mechanism**
- ✅ **Prevention of result manipulation**
- ✅ **One-shot randomness commitment**

Technical accuracy is critical for user trust! 🎯
